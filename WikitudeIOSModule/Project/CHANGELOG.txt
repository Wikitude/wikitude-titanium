Version 0.1

This version provides a very basic implementation of the Wikitude integration module.

KNOWN ISSUES

	-	whenever a Wikitude view which makes use of trackers for image recognition
		purposes gets destroyed, the process is "freezed" for several seconds
	-	whenever a Wikitude view temporarily loses focus, some resources should to 
		be released, in order to reduce computation, memory and power consumption
