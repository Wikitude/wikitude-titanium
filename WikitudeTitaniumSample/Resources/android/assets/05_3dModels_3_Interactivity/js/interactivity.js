			3D content within Wikitude can only be loaded from Wikitude 3D Format files (.wt3).

The Encoder can handle Autodesk速 FBX速 files (.fbx) and the open standard Collada (.dae) file formats for encoding to .wt3.

			A function is attached to the onLoaded trigger to receive a notification once the 3D model is fully loaded. Depending on the size of the model and where it is stored (locally or remotely) it might take some time to completely load and it is recommended to inform the user about the loading time.
